Arduino Nano + SIM800A GSM Module to ThingSpeak
This project demonstrates how to send sensor data from an Arduino Nano to the ThingSpeak IoT platform using a SIM800A GSM module over HTTP.
Itâ€™s designed for locations without Wi-Fi, using the cellular network to transmit data.

ðŸ›  Features
Collect sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity) from Arduino.
Send data to ThingSpeak via GSM (SIM800A).
Works in areas without internet access via Wi-Fi.
Can be adapted for multiple fields (up to 8 ThingSpeak fields).

ðŸ“‹ Hardware Required
Arduino Nano
SIM800A GSM/GPRS module
Jumper wires
Breadboard
External 5Vâ€“9V power supply (recommended for SIM800A, as Arduinoâ€™s 5V pin may not supply enough current)
(Optional) Sensors such as DHT11/DHT22 for temperature & humidity.

ðŸ”Œ Wiring Diagram
Arduino Nano Pin	SIM800A Pin
D2	TXD
D3	RXD
GND	GND
5V / External	VCC (5â€“9V)

âš  Important: SIM800A requires 2A peak current during transmission.
Use an external regulated power supply if possible.

ðŸ“„ Code Overview
The code:
Initializes a SoftwareSerial connection with the GSM module.
Configures the SIM800A to connect to the mobile network.
Opens a TCP connection to api.thingspeak.com.
Sends data using a GET request to your ThingSpeak API key.
Closes the connection.

Replace:
cpp
Copy
Edit
String str = "GET https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=O13AOCHYYNU2LQ19&field1=" + String(t) + "&field2=" + String(h);
with your own ThingSpeak API key and variables.

ðŸ–¥ ThingSpeak Setup
Create an account at ThingSpeak.
Create a New Channel with your desired fields (e.g., field1 = Temperature, field2 = Humidity).
Copy your Write API Key from the channel settings.
Paste it into the Arduino code where O13AOCHYYNU2LQ19 is.

ðŸ“¡ APN Configuration
Change the APN in:
cpp
Copy
Edit
gprsSerial.println("AT+CSTT=\"airtelgprs.com\"");
to your SIM card providerâ€™s APN (e.g., for Grameenphone: "internet", for Robi: "internet").

---->Usage
Upload the code to your Arduino Nano.
Power the SIM800A with a stable supply.
Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud) to see connection logs.
Check your ThingSpeak channel for live updates.
